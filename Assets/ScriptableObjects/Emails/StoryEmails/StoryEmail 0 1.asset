  body: 'Good morning,



    A very warm welcome from myself. My name is Abby, and
    I am your department manager. You should have already received instructions regarding
    your responsibilities and how to effectively complete your allocated case files.
    I have informed Ethan to reach out to you in case you need any further guidance.



    Regarding
    the upcoming elections, you may hear talk of a reshuffling in the department.
    I want to assure you not to worry yourself about any of that. Work will resume
    as usual.



    Kind Regards,



    Abby
